# JavaScript coding style

Douglas Crockford is always right.

Documentation is based on https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/js-for-compiler


# Twitter Bootstrap

Basketball GM currently uses Bootstrap 2.1 with a few changes to make it work more like 2.0:

* @baseFontSize set to 13px in variables.less
* @baseLineHeight set to 18px in variables.less
* The headings section of type.less with altered sizes and margins:

	// Headings
	// -------------------------

	h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
	  margin: 0;
	  font-family: @headingsFontFamily;
	  font-weight: @headingsFontWeight;
	  line-height: 1;
	  color: @headingsColor;
	  text-rendering: optimizelegibility; // Fix the character spacing for headings
	  small {
	    font-weight: normal;
	    line-height: 1;
	    color: @grayLight;
	  }
	}
	h1 { font-size: 30px; line-height: 36px; }
	h2 { font-size: 24px; line-height: 36px; }
	h3 { font-size: 18px; line-height: 27px; }
	h4 { font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; }
	h5 { font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; }
	h6 { font-size: 11px; line-height: 18px; }

	h1 small { font-size: 18px; }
	h2 small { font-size: 18px; }
	h3 small { font-size: 14px; }
	h4 small { font-size: 12px; }


# Basketball stuff

Abbreviations of stats should be done like basketball-reference.com stat pages.
For instance, "defensive rebounds" is "drb".
