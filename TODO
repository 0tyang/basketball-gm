smarter realtime
----------------

owner message still being sent?
draft buttons sometimes don't work? why?
ui.realtimeUpdate should be used in more places so updateEvent is pervasive
  use req.redirect from POST to manage history optimally
  add playerMovement updateEvent, for when a player signs a contract, becomes a free agent, or is traded
awards not being set?
check for other things in uiEvery - should they also be computed observables in uiFirst?
  check:
    teamFinances
    trade
gameLog
  update docs
  make sure observables are being set correctly
bbgmView
  IMPORTANT:
    do idLoaded/idLoading work?
      can i do some check to abandon in display if idLoading is mismatched with reality?
      click link twice quickly - should work
        doesn't work for dashboard, but seems to work everywhere else
    what about non-league views? how to distinguish?
      more broadly.. make this less tied to BBGM specifically. shouldn't depend on BBGM-specific modules like g, ui, and util/viewHelpers
      fn to convert req to relevant vars? but isn't that what get already is?
dashboard
  observables set right by mapping
    historical things (old scores, old records) don't need to be observable?
    arrays need correct keys
  update vm directly from functions?
    if so, will need to define structure earlier
  move functions to module-level scope?
shouldn't have newPhase updateEvent doing much. instead, have an array of what changed in that phase
  (updateEvents.indexOf("newPhase") >= 0 && g.phase === g.PHASE.PRESEASON) should be newSeason
team finances
  rounded budget amounts are not updated
    they are saved correctly, but knockout doesn't seem to update the UI http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16006558/updating-an-input-whose-value-attribute-is-bound-to-an-observable-after-editing
      or http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/extenders.html live example 1
  smarter updating of player salaries table
  teamFinances updateEvent for when the form is changed (or, i guess, if the AI team does it, but that doesn't happen yet)
  move some stuff to loadAfter?
  confirm events aren't going crazy
  contracts should only update on playerMovement
datatables
  update in loadAfter, not display
general things
  performance considerations...

    http://tekpub.com/productions/knockout
  reduce boilerplate
after updating all views
  reassess ui module. delete stuff like ui.dropdown. move other functions elsewhere?
    what is the difference between util.viewHelpers and ui?
  reassess api module (pretty much everything should be moved into a view if it's used in one place, or viewHelpers if it's used multiple places)
not urgetnt, but... use knockout for
  components.dropdown
  gameLog.boxScore
  feasible to use knockout for updating datatable? or kogrid?
  trade - not fully knockoutifieid
    mapping to update summary.teams.trade, userRoster, otherRoster
    can i do a redirect from post without refreshing everything?
      just call ui.realtimeUpdate which should allow for smart handling
        if trade is accepted/cleared, playerMovement will instigate a refresh of rosters
        if trade is proposed, message will somehow explicity be sent (set in VM? but what if VM not initialized?)
    when to delete stored message?
      at beginning of new propose
      on clear
      when team changes
    changing the trading partner shouldn't refresh the user's team
  negotiation
    some things can probably be non-observable
  draftSummary
    don't show this season as option if before draft - have an option in components.dropdown
  playerNameLabels always updates even if none of the inputs did - why
    if ratings.skills is generated by the mapping plugin, it's an observable array and this fucks things up. it would be a bitch to fix, though.
      quick fix - return a string for templates rather than array.
  leaders
    flatten a bit
  roster
    check release, buy out, trade for
    flatten a bit

  inbox
    on new message (can be a newMessage update event), just add to messages list rather than always refreshing
  player_
    face display with forward/back button?
      some things become observables - why???
      mapping function not run right the second time - try to create jsfiddle
        arrays are becoming observableArrays
  schedule, teamHistory
    partial load of list for updates, like in gameLog list
  freeagents
    optimize refreshes
  dist
    allow updating box plots without refresh
  reassess dropdown - should it really be called like it is in uiEvery? can i use a computed? problem is, some things need to listen to updateEvents too, not just observables

BEFORE 3.0.0-beta.3
-------------------

after winning title - "We need to make some real noise in the playoffs. Soon."
sub-views like shot locations should retain league menu highlighting
core.freeAgents should be core.freeAgent
after last resigning negotiation, switch to next phase
if no stats/ratings are requested, db.getPlayers should return no stats/players properties on object
check effects of extreme ticket prices
show old contracts on old roster view
popup windows should still be popup windows, even after navigating reloading page
profits too large? add corporate tax
draft lottery
  do a dramatic presentation?
  increase hype for teams that exceed expectations
  tied records?
versionchange in tests in chrome?
how to handle aggregating stats for players who played for more than one team in a season? add them all up in ps in db.getPlayers
  for roster, want just a player's stats with this team this season
    this currently works, just pass a tid
  for player stats view, want total among all teams for one season
    no pass tid and you only get the latest row. need added logic to do sum
  for player view, want separate and combined rows in careerStats without fucking up totals (including PER)
    no pass tid and you get each team separately, but no merged stats as above
https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/eventTrackerGuide
  get rid of bbgmPing
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9534793/google-analytics-cross-domain-tracking-and-setdomainname
http://www.gmgames.org
better default league name
contracts
  maybe also try making contract demands depend on PER, if it is available
  maybe make them nonlinear.. role players lower, stars higher
    compare to NBA contract distribution
luxury tax should be disbursed amongst non-taxpaying teams
give bbgm website its own version of bootstrap (only with components needed)
display league/season counter on basketball-gm.com splash page
team history view needs more love
  dropdown for other teams
move most db functions into core.whatever. db should just be about initializing/upgrading
db.getPlayers
  way way way too messy
  rename to helpers.filterPlayers? or player.filter and player.filterAll?
    make db.getTeams consistent with this
  use for other access of players "playersAll"
  the special case attributes should generally be moved directly into the database?
  Replace showNoStats with a check of stats.length in db.getPlayer, at least in some cases? API is messy
show record (w-l) on roster view - make it more like a summary, as in basketball-reference
  playoff results
  payroll
  anything else?
how to deal with a team that drops below 5 active players, factoring in injuries?
  should minimum roster size be higher?
  should allow them to exceed roster limit while injury exists
  should not allow play when below 5
  should use same logic/functions as core.season that checks on new season.
    first, add support for auto-add players when AI teams are below limit (in season.js)
injured reserve - 2 last rosterOrder spaces beyond normal 13 (btw.. change 12 to 13)
  don't play in games, but you can stash injured players here or whatever
  like in yahoo fantasy, allow dragging to empty category
notifications (and log) from top right to display log of key events
  game results from user's team
  players retiring from user's team
  league champions
  trades
  free agent signings
  if a player on your team refuses to resign, there should be appropriate handling of this message
  helpers.error in core.season
team.rosterAutoSort should automatically set dbChanged, and have an option to not if that's important

BEFORE 3.0.0
------------

core.trade refactoring
  validateSavedTids crap should be in trade.js.
  trade.summary stuff should be automatic and stored in tradeStore
  trade and clear buttons should be disabled during gameSim, wiht message like in team finances
too easy to do the "be bad, get draft picks, keep payroll low, sign free agents, be good" pattern
  free agents are even less willing to sign with the user, even if it's a good team
  user can't just sign all the free agents before AI teams
final score, hall of fame
  influenced by size of city (see: difficulty in views.newLeague)
any raw data files should go in the data folder, ideally with a script to convert them to however they're used here
database changes
  add activeYears multientry like statsTids use for:
    league leaders
    stats
    ratings
gameSim
  rename compositeRating to compositeRatings (or something better)
    other plural issues in gameSim
  playing time not adding up to 240?
  do some kind of profiling, see if i can speed it up
    any way to speed up PER? maybe break it up into smaller functions so they can be profiled
    do i need all the player composite ratings?
    do i need all the team composite ratings?
    how does performance change/degrade as the years go on?
internationalization
  league dashboard rankings should say 1st, 2nd, 3rd rather than 1th, 2th, 3th
  http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#i18n
in lock functions, update g from database before using any potentially sensitive values
  or should these g.whatever variables be set at all if they're sensitive? lid doesn't change obviously, but the others?
move to new window button, like gmail, that will open a view in a new window with a minimal UI
  only the icon should be clickable, not the area above and below
AI modules that contain functions which are called to determine actions
  mode: rebuild or contend
  things to regulate...
    draft picks
    signing free agents
    resigning players
    trades
    budget items (like from team finances view)
    releasing/buying out players when over limit
show an option to upload a data file for rosters
  nba roster
    define file format for external player sources
    derive from stats, somehow?
    nba player potential ratings
    if necessary, scale everything down a bit to make it comparable to normal players
    free agents are way overrated. is this roster file legit?
player finder
  search by stats or ratings
  trade for button, or sign button if free agent
customize which columns are shown in roster view (and possibly other summary views like trade, free agent, etc)
  http://datatables.net/extras/colvis/
PER
  slow, particularly after multiple seasons?
    can i have it share a transaction with writing stats in core.game?
  how to deal with players traded mid-season?
    reevaluate this in general. stats don't seem to be showing after a trade in roster view and player view.
  use for awards, contracts
some UI showing the state of the team's synergy. maybe like an advisors screen that suggests what kind of player is needed to improve synergy
  also can respond to budget changes
more handlebars helpers for things like...
  team dropdown
  season dropdown
trades
  draft picks
  cash
  sign and trade (only during resigning phase)
  allow trades to go over the roster limit, but show a warning. also factor into AI logic that they would have to drop a player
go through future list - anything that should be here?
DataTables - fix default sort order on column click
  text should be asc, numeric should be desc (except draft picks)
  http://datatables.net/ref#asSorting will work. maybe pass it as an option to bbgm_datatable
  but can it be set globally, based on column type? can have ui.datatable automatically read columns and figure it out?
more tests
  https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul
  https://github.com/metagriffin/indexeddb-js can i improve this and run tests outside of browser?
like on team finances page, anywhere else to add help popups?
  should this be abstracted rather than just inline in views?
  inline anything from the manual?
tweak gameSim for stats again
freeAgentMoods should affect AI team signings - or should it?
  for resigning players
  for signing free agents
bar graphs
  gradients like http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html#progress
AI updating of *Budgets and ticket prices
  maybe not necessary at this stage?
  call core.finances.updateBudgetRanks() after
team finances template: handlebars helper for form DRY?
update formulas
  nationalTvRevenue
    same for each team, change contract year by year and display in team finances
  localTvRevenue
    eventually, t.seasons[0].tvContract
roster reordering
  make only handles draggable, not whole row
playoff seeding rules
  division winner should get at least 4th seed in playoffs, but still do homecourt by best record in a matchup

FUTURE (after 3.0.0)
--------------------

league database error during game simulation in chrome?
  is this a linux-only bug?
  did this work in old chrome?
    YES, chrome 25 works
  does this work in future chrome?
    NO, chrome 27 has the same problem as 26
  make a minimal example, post to chromium-dev or somewhere else
    update play.basketball-gm.com first
    commenting out finances call seems to make errors lessen. WHY?? makes no sense
    opening transaction over less object stores seems to make errors lessen, even if those object stores aren't used. WHY?? makes no sense
  cb after add in writeGameStats
    could add them all in a transaction first, and then do another transaction to add/update all other stats
      wouldn't matter since even commenting out add still leaves problems
  try to delete writePlayerStats, writeTeamStats, and/or writeGameStats and see if it's still a problem
  try to separate each game into separate transaction, see if still issue
  seems to at least run longer than before. the only error i get is "Internal error checking key existence." or null cursor (for either players or teams)
    they usually persist through reloads, but not always.
    null cursor seems to persist through reloads, but with a different player id each time!
    internal error, they seem to persist with same GID, during writeTeamStats
jslint errors
  currently just "Don't make functions within a loop." which should all be fixed eventually
more sophisticatedrealtime data binding/updating
  one usability advantage would be keeping help popups, dropdown menus, etc. open even as the content refreshes.
  ember.js
    data binding
    uses handlebars
  knockoutjs is too flaky. try just a naive approach first, and use something better later
    try again?
  angularjs
    seems nice and widely used. would need to build some kind of signal system on top of this, basically to update the UI data variables from indexeddb when appropriate
Web workers
  don't seem to actually help performance. maybe help responsiveness
  benchmark?
  would it be worth it to parallelize advstats?
boxplots for shot location stats, plus comparison to NBA data
import/export stuff
  online "locker" that you can sync saved games to
  https://unhosted.org/adventures/7/Adding-remote-storage-to-unhosted-web-apps.html
  data urls don't work with more than ~1 MB. downloadifydoesn't seem to work with more than several MBs of data. until a better solution comes (online sync?), wait.
  league names
    "Edit" button between "Export" and "Delete" - set in leaguesStore and gameAttributes
      move delete/edit/export under one button, "manage". have the 3 buttons pop out in place when you hit manage, then it functions as it does now. popped buttons can be colored too, then
  import league
    ignore old lid
other advanced stats
  WS - http://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ws.html requires Basketball on Paper - http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/about/ws.html is simpler
  +/- and other stats needed to calculate above - track in game
  APM?
hitting the phase twice shouldn't be possible. but if i, for instance, hit "until preseason" twice quickly, i skip a year
  maybe have something like lock.phaseChangeInProgress? but some timeout would be needed to reset
worth it to switch to closure library? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10782612/what-is-the-sturdiest-way-to-get-the-closure-compilers-type-safety-together-wit
roster size check on new season
  cpu teams with < 5 players should automatically sign free agents
moving to other cities
expansion teams (add population growth, expand when certain conditions are met)
team finances view
  compare bar graphs against league averages?
different size stadiums, building new stadiums
tv revenue as a variable
  local tv contract - $10 million
    base on tvContractAmount, tvContractExp
    will be a deal from 3 to 5 years in length
    based on...
      region population
      "hype"
      random noise
      "random event" - competition between two networks, Sports TV and The Basketball Channel
    when renegotiating and really bad, the guy pretends not to know you - "Atlanta Herons? Is that the team from the Mexican/Canadian/Arena/Indoor/Xtreme Volleyball/Soccer/Tennis/Racing/Curling/MudWrestling League?"
stat views
  add team dropdown to ratings and stats views - but should this refresh the view, or just filter the DataTable?
    could use something like http://www.datatables.net/extras/thirdparty/ColumnFilterWidgets/DataTables/extras/ColumnFilterWidgets/ to also filter on positions
  playoff/regular season toggle in team/player stats, league leaders
  player stats: toggle to only show players > 2000 minutes http://www.nba.com/leader_requirements.html
  per 36 stats in team/player stats view, league leaders
    add a dropdown (maybe make the dropdown handling code more general?)
bootstrap 2.3
https://github.com/nprapps/app-template
refactor views.js
  IS IT WORTH DOING THIS BEFORE SWITCHING TO something like knockout?
  where to call beforeleague/nonleague? can this be automatic?
  how to structure?
    separate "init" and "update" functions or whatever?
    meta-views for similar views?
    modularize and build testable functions that generate the data for the UI
trading block
race conditions associated with callbacks when passing around transactions
  any put/add/update does not guarantee it's finished until the transaction finishes. but letting transactions finish is slow.
contract negotiation
  add free agent to the end of roster
eliminate jquery UI dependency? it's only used for roster reordering currently
real calendar
  player.injury.gamesRemaining
core.gameSim.updateSynergy should produce continuous output
  no big difference between a 80 rating and 79 rating, or whatever
input to helpers.formatCurrency (and all currency in variables everywhere) should be in 1000s of dollars and then only converted to millions when displayed
AI teams should have to deal with fuzz too
if play menu is open when it refreshes, automatically open it again after refresh
  not so easy.. tried it in 34927959b2b0acd08224665654343d97ffaea281 but there were issues with updatePlayMenu being called multiple times, for instance at the end of the season
"dbChanged" updateEvent - more correct way
  store a list of times and "update events". compare last updated time against that list, and then see the update events. pass as list in "update event" to realtime update

# Pre-JavaScript TODO

player view
  next, previous buttons (also active on left/right arrows)

roster
  highlight handle on hover, like button
  "trade for" only sensitive when trades are allowed

Client-side game simulation
  Robustness of javascript code
    g.phase == 3 in league_views might introduce race condition
    validate data from client?
    make sure play menu doesn't ever get stuck - some kind of timeout

play button requirements
  colors - is this a good idea?
    green: move to new phase
    blue: play games
    red: other immediate action

make validate_season work correctly

include sidebar(s) showing all relevant information, plus make that stuff generated by a separate function so it can eventually be kept static as JS updates other content

AI (NON-GAMESIM)
----------------
trade
  AI teams trade with each other
  opponent GM trade AI based on their team's status: contending or rebuilding
  record player value for contending and rebuilding teams in player_attributes, so opposing GMs can more easily suggest trades (i.e. "i'll make the deal if you throw in X")
  Feedback from trades (way off, that's close, etc)
  "Oh, you again?" after failed trade attempts
  AI teams should be aware of contract lengths and the implications thereof
AI teams release/buy out players to sign a better free agent

FEATURES
--------
multi-team trades... how can i make a good UI for that?
