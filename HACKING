# Plea for help

Do you like this game? Or, do you at least like the idea of what this game
could one day be? Then PLEASE HELP US! We need people with all kinds of skill
sets to work on (and this is not an exhaustive list):

* Artwork
* UI design and implementation
* Database optimization
* Game simulation
* Opposing manager AI
* Localization
* New gameplay features

So please, get the code on GitHub <https://github.com/jdscheff/basketball-gm>
and start hacking. Or email me <jdscheff@gmail.com> and we can discuss how you
want to contribute.


# JavaScript coding style

Douglas Crockford is always right.

Documentation is based on https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/js-for-compiler


# Twitter Bootstrap

Basketball GM currently uses Bootstrap 2.1 compiled with a few changes to make it work more like 2.0:

* @baseFontSize set to 13px in variables.less
* @baseLineHeight set to 18px in variables.less

There are more changes in bbgm.css, but the baseFontSize and baseLineHeight stuff is too much of a bitch to do that way, because they are used in so many places.


# Basketball stuff

Abbreviations of stats should be done like basketball-reference.com stat pages.
For instance, "defensive rebounds" is "drb".
