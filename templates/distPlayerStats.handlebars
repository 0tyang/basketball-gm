<h1>Player Stat Distributions {{new_window}}</h1>

<p>These <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot">box plots</a> show the league-wide distributions of player stats for all active players in the selected season. Black plots are for this league and blue plots are from the 2009-2010 NBA season, for comparison. NBA data was generously provided by <a href="http://www.databasebasketball.com/stats_download.htm">databaseBasketball.com</a>. The five vertical lines in each plot represent the minimum of the scale, the minimum, the first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile">quartile</a>, the median, the third quartile, the maximum, and the maximum of the scale.</p>
