<h1>Multi Team Mode</h1>

<p>Here you can switch from controlling one team to controlling multiple teams. Why would you want to do this? A few reasons I can think of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Live in-person multiplayer - two people using one computer can play in the same league together</li>
  <li>Extreme control - if for whatever reason you want to control how other teams behave</li>
  <li>Online multiplayer - if you want to run a league where you are the commissioner and other people email you roster moves to make manually, you don't want AI fucking things up</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kly-bxCBZg">multi til the motherfucking sun die</a>.</p>
