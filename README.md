Dependencies
------------

Required packages on Ubuntu 11.04 (probably similar on other distros):

* libsqlite3-0
* python
* python-egenix-mxdatetime
* python-gtk2

Optional packages (speeds up gameplay by about 10%):

* python-numpy

To install all these packages in Ubuntu, run:

    sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-0 python-egenix-mxdatetime python-gtk2 python-numpy

I haven't tried any other platforms, but if you install the packages listed
above on Windows, maybe it would work.


Running and/or installing
-------------------------

To run the game from this directory:

    ./bin/basketball-gm

Or, to install the game system-wide and then run it:

    sudo python setup.py install

    basketball-gm

The system-wide install through setup.py should also make a launcher for "Basketball GM".
