<h1>Delete Old Data <span data-bind="newWindow: []"></span></h1>

<p>As you play multiple seasons in a league, the game tends to slow down as data is accumulated in the database. For instance, if you play 20 seasons, game simulation will be approximately twice as slow as in a new league. If you delete old data using the form below, it will restore performance to roughly that of a new league.</p>
