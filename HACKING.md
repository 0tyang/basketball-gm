# Plea for help

Do you like this game? Or, do you at least like the idea of what this game
could one day be? Then PLEASE HELP US! We need people with all kinds of skill
sets to work on (and this is not an exhaustive list):

* Artwork
* UI design and implementation
* Database optimization
* Game simulation
* Opposing manager AI
* Localization
* New gameplay features

So please, get the code on GitHub <https://github.com/jdscheff/basketball-gm>
and start hacking. Or email me <jdscheff@gmail.com> and we can discuss how you
want to contribute.



# RequireJS Optimizer

Basketball GM uses the RequireJS optimizer to combine JavaScript files and
templates into one minified file. Installation instructions can be found here
http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html#download (you should install through
npm). Then, just run:

      make build-requirejs

(Running  just `make` will run the RequireJS optimizer and minify CSS.)

Alternatively, to use the unminified uncombined JavaScript files, just change

      <script src="/gen/app.js"></script>

to

      <script data-main="/js/app.js" src="/js/lib/require.js"></script>

in index.html. This is convenient for development, since any change to a .js or
.html file will immediately be reflected after a page reload.



# Templates

Templates use Knockout for realtime updates.

As noted above, templates are compiled by the RequireJS Optimizer. If you want
to add a new template, you have to add a reference to it in js/templates.js.



# CSS

By default, a minified CSS file is used. This is done using YUI Compressor
(which is available in Ubuntu via `sudo apt-get install yui-compressor` - for
other OSes, Google for install instructions). To update the minified CSS file,
run:

    make build-css

(Running  just `make` will run the RequireJS optimizer and minify CSS.)

Alternatively, you can use the unminified CSS files by switching a couple
comments in index.html.



# Documentation

Code is documented as described in the Google Closure Compiler documentation:
<https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/js-for-compiler>. Google
Closure Compiler itself isn't actually used for anything (yet). To update the
HTML-based documentation in the docs folder, install JsDoc Toolkit 2 (available
in the Ubuntu repos as `jsdoc-toolkit`) and then run `make docs`, which will
generate documentation and stick it in the docs folder.



# JavaScript coding style

Douglas Crockford is always right. Well, usually. See `make lint` for details.

Documentation of functions is based on
https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/js-for-compiler



# Twitter Bootstrap

Basketball GM currently uses Bootstrap 2.2 compiled without responsive parts and
with a few changes to make it work more like 2.0:

* @baseFontSize set to 13px in variables.less
* @baseLineHeight set to 18px in variables.less

There are more changes in bbgm.css, but the baseFontSize and baseLineHeight
stuff is too much of a bitch to do that way, because they are used in so many
places.



# Basketball stuff

Abbreviations of stats should be done like basketball-reference.com stat pages.
For instance, "defensive rebounds" is "drb".



# To do on new version

- Make sure unit tests all pass
- (if necessary) Write database upgrade code and notification message in db.js
- Set version in basketball-gm.com, index.html, CHANGES.md, and README.md, like http://semver.org/
- Tag it in git:

    git tag -a v3.0.0-beta.2 -m ''
    git push --tags
