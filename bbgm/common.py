    """Shortcut function to update a list of players in a treeview.

    This function will update a list of, i.e., players (showing stats, ratings,
    whatever) in a treeview by updating players already in the model, deleting
    players who should no longer be in the model, and adding players who now
    need to be in the model. So if the user switches to viewing another team,
    or new stats are recorded, or a trade happens, etc... this function can
    handle it.

    This works most efficiently when all the rows in the model need updating.
    Otherwise, it's somewhat inefficient and I should probably write another
    function optimized for those cases.

    Three queries are used rather than just one because when a player is first
    added to a team (or at the beginning of a season), he doesn't have any
    stats with that team, so that would fuck up queries on player_stats.

    If you're absolutely sure you'll never need them, the last four arguments
    are optional.

    There are a few gotchas, so please read the description of the arguments
    below.

    Args:
        treeview: Gtk.treeview instance. Must already have a model, such as if
            treeview_build_new is called first. Also, the first column in the
            model MUST correspond to the IDs returned by query_ids.
        query_ids: SQL query that will return a list of player IDs for the
            players that are to be shown.
        params_ids: A list of parameters used in query_ids.
        query_row: SQL query that will run for each player ID from the other
            query, and return exactly the elements to add to the model for this
            player.
        params_row: A list of parameters used in query_row. NOTE: the first
            parameter in this list should be a dummy/placeholder, as it is
            replaced by the appropriate player ID!
        query_row_alt: SQL query that will run for each player ID in cases when
            there is nothing returned for query_row (i.e. no stats right after
            the draft).
        params_row_alt: Like params_row, but for query_row_alt.
        query_row_alt_2: SQL query that will run for each player ID in cases
            when there is nothing returned for query_row (i.e. no stats right
            after the draft).
        params_row_alt_2: Like params_row, but for query_row_alt_2.
