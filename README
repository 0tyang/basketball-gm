Dependencies
------------

Required packages on Ubuntu 11.04 (probably similar on other distros):

* libsqlite3-0
* python >= 2.5
* python-egenix-mxdatetime
* python-gtk2

Optional packages (speeds up gameplay by about 10%):

* python-numpy

To install all these packages in Ubuntu, run:

sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-0 python-egenix-mxdatetime python-gtk2 python-numpy

I haven't tried any other platforms, but if you install the packages listed
above on Windows, maybe it would work.


Use
---

To run the game, just execute:
./bin/basketball-gm
