# Basketball GM 3.0.0alpha

A single-player basketball simulation game. Make trades, set rosters, draft
players, and try to build the next dynasty, all from within your web browser.
The game is implemented entirely in client-side JavaScript, backed by
IndexedDB.

## Warning

This is an incomplete port of Basketball GM from PyGObject (GTK+) to web-based
technologies. Ultimately, this may or may not be a good idea. Due to all the
missing features still, I haven't put a lot of time into making it easy to use.
It's basically only of interest to developers now, but hopefully that will
change soon.

## Installing and Running

Everything is implemented in client-side JavaScript. The current version will
ONLY work in recent versions of Mozilla Firefox due to its superior support for
IndexedDB. Besides that, you just need some way of running a web server to
display the content. The easiest way is using the `runserver.py` file included
here. If you install Python and web.py (as simple as `sudo apt-get install
python-webpy` on Ubuntu), then you can run:

    python runserver.py

Then, point your browser to http://0.0.0.0:8080/

## Debugging and Problem Solving

If something starts behaving weirdly (this is alpha software), you can reset you
database by clicking the "Reset DB" link at the bottom of any page. If that
still doesn't work (which unfortunately happens sometimes with a corrupted
database), delete the folder named `http+++0.0.0.0+8080` within the `indexedDB`
folder in your Firefox profile folder. That will delete all of the game's stored
data.

To run the (currently tiny) test suite, go to http://0.0.0.0:8080/test
