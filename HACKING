# Plea for help

Do you like this game? Or, do you at least like the idea of what this game
could one day be? Then PLEASE HELP US! We need people with all kinds of skill
sets to work on (and this is not an exhaustive list):

* Artwork
* UI design and implementation
* Database optimization
* Game simulation
* Opposing manager AI
* Localization
* New gameplay features

So please, get the code on GitHub <https://github.com/jdscheff/basketball-gm>
and start hacking. Or email me <jdscheff@gmail.com> and we can discuss how you
want to contribute.


# RequireJS Optimizer

Basketball GM uses the RequireJS optimizer to combine JavaScript files into one
minified file. Installation instructions can be found here
http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html#download (you should install through
npm). Then, just run:

	make build-requirejs

(Running  just `make` will run the RequireJS optimizer and compile templates as
described in the following section.)

Alternatively, to use the normal unminified uncombined JavaScript files, just
change "gen/app.js" to "js/app.js" in index.html. This is convenient for
development.


# Handlebars templates

Any change made to one of the templates will not be processed until it is
compiled, as described here <http://handlebarsjs.com/precompilation.html>.
After installing the Handlebars precompiler, run this command from this
folder to update the templates:

    make build-templates

(Running  just `make` will compile templates and run the RequireJS optimizer.)


# Documentation

Code is documented as described in the Google Closure Compiler documentation:
<https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/js-for-compiler>. Google
Closure Compiler isn't actually used for anything (yet). To update the HTML-
based documentation in the docs folder, install JsDoc Toolkit 2 (available
in the Ubuntu repos as `jsdoc-toolkit`) and then run `make docs`, which will
generate documentation and stick it in the docs folder.


# JavaScript coding style

Douglas Crockford is always right. Well, usually. See `make lint` for details.

Documentation of functions is based on
https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/js-for-compiler


# Twitter Bootstrap

Basketball GM currently uses Bootstrap 2.2 compiled without responsive parts and
with a few changes to make it work more like 2.0:

* @baseFontSize set to 13px in variables.less
* @baseLineHeight set to 18px in variables.less

There are more changes in bbgm.css, but the baseFontSize and baseLineHeight
stuff is too much of a bitch to do that way, because they are used in so many
places.


# Basketball stuff

Abbreviations of stats should be done like basketball-reference.com stat pages.
For instance, "defensive rebounds" is "drb".
