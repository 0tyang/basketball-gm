Plea for help

Do you like this game? Or, do you at least like the idea of what this game
could one day be? Then PLEASE HELP US! We need people with all kinds of skill
sets to work on (and this is not an exhaustive list):

* Artwork
* UI design and implementation
* Database optimization
* Game simulation
* Opposing manager AI
* Localization
* New gameplay features

So please, get the code on GitHub <https://github.com/jdscheff/basketball-gm>

want to contribute.


Coding style

http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ with the following exceptions:

* Don't worry too much about line length, for now.

* Use Google-style comments, because I like them better
