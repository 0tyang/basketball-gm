    """Set a new phase of the game.

    This function is called to do all the crap that must be done during transitions between phases of the game, such as
    moving from the regular season to the playoffs. Phases are defined as:
        0: Preseason
        1: Regular season, before trade deadline
        2: Regular season, after trade deadline (NOTE: this isn't implemented yet)
        3: Playoffs
        4: Offseason, before draft
        5: Draft
        6: Offseason, after draft
        7: Offseason, free agency

    Returns:
        False if everything went well, or the string containing an error message
        to be sent to the client.
